1. To implement user needs into a program, start by gathering requirements through doing user research. Then, create the user stories to break down the features into units. Then, prioritize and develop the user stories iteratively. Also, test it for feedback with the tester. While doing this, make sure to track the progress using the project management tools to make sure all the requirements meet and everything is done effectively.

2. When approaching program development, I would consider using scrum or the agile method. The scrum process emphhasize collaboration and flexibility in response to changes in requirements. By using the agile process, I could deliver high-quality software products that can meet user needs efficiently and effectively.

3. What it means to be a good team member in software development is being a team player. For instance, always work as a team and make sure to be on the same page as the other team members and work with the users needs in mind in order to create a high-quality well functioning product.
